Python interface to Familinx
============================
Python scripts in this directory provide an interface to the database Familinx.
The interface is wrapped by the FamilinxUI.py file.

To get started we have prepared a script that uses the interface and calculates pairwise kinship scores for two individuals selected by the user.
If this operation fails the script will try to troubleshoot the problem and print to the screen output for each stage.
Make sure you install the dependent python libraries before trying this (see below).
To run the script type the following in a Unix shell:
>> python pwIBDscript.py -i 1,2
...
For help type  
>> python pwIBDscript.py -h 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to use the interface directly start python and type:
>> import FamilinxUI
>> ?FamilinxUI
	This Module serves as an interface to the Familinx MySQL database
	It uses python modules from: libs/
	... (more help content)

>> FamilinxUI.Getter.getParents(1) # getting the parents of individual 1 
[4, 5]

More examples are provided in the documentation of the modules and functions.
>> ?familinxUI.Getter # etc.


Dependencies
============
	Python 2.6.5 or above
	MySQLdb 1.2.2. or above (http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/)	
	NumPy 1.6.2 or above (http://www.numpy.org/)


Configuring (Advanced)
======================
The configuration file that allows the python interface to connect to the MySQL database is: libs/__init__.py

Configuring the python interface with the database: 
*) Make sure you have a valid user name with privileges to access the MySQL database. 
*) The database name, user name and password for accessing the database are hard-coded in the configuration file.

For example, suppose the MySQL database was named "familinx", and the user "obama" has access to this database with password: "whitehouse".
Then, the configuration file should look like this:
DATABASE='familinx'
USER='obama'
PASSWORD='whitehouse'
